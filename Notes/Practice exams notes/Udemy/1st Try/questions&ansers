Question 1Correct

Your team is designing a new User-facing application to serve requests. Service Level Objectives (SLOs) have been set. Your team has been mandated to ensure the application always meets the set SLOs. Your Job is to choose Service Level Indicators (SLIs) that will allow your team effectively monitor the system so it does not breach the SLOs.

Which of the following is Google's SRE suggested best practice for selecting SLIs?
A. Choose as many SLIs as possible to cover all aspects of the system that users interact with.
B. Choose as few SLIs as possible to reduce unactionable alerts
Your answer is correct
C. Discover what users expect from the system and choose SLIs to measure it.
D. Allow users to give feedback on issues before choosing SLIs.

Overall explanation

Correct Answer: C

    Option A is incorrect, because choosing too many indicators makes it hard to pay the right level of attention to the indicators that matter

    Option B is incorrect, because choosing too few may leave significant behaviours of your system unexamined.

    Option C is CORRECT. Google’s recommended approach is an understanding of what your users want from the system will inform the judicious selection of a few indicators.

    Option D is incorrect, because it means the system isn’t monitored which is not recommended.

Question 2Correct

Your team manages an application serving a global audience. A recent update caused a service downtime. You have been designated as the Incident commander.

Which of the following should not be in the Incident Document according to Google SRE's best practices?
A. Incident timeline.
B. List of Actions carried out to restore the service.
Your answer is correct
C. The developers responsible for the update.
D. Command hierarchy.
Overall explanation

Correct Answer: C

    Options A, B and D are incorrect because it is a Google SRE best practice that those information are in the live Incident State Document as the service is being restored .

    Option C is CORRECT, this should not be in the document to promote a blameless culture.

Question 3Correct

You are helping with the design of a data processing pipeline for a company. Data is streamed from different devices into the pipeline and then processed before it is loaded into the final storage for analytic use.  You want to identify minimal Service Level Indicators (SLIs) for the pipeline to ensure that the data in the final storage is up to date.

Which SLI should not be part of your consideration?
A. Throughput.
B. Latency.
C. Correctness.
Your answer is correct
D. Durability.
Overall explanation

Correct Answer: D

    Option D is CORRECT, this is SLI provides no monitoring value for the data processing pipeline.

    Options A, B & C are incorrect because they are recommended SLIs for big data systems. Throughput shows speed of processing and latency shows total time to process a request. Correctness measures the accuracy of results returned.

Question 4Correct

You are part of the SRE team tasked with writing a postmortem of an outage for one of the services your team manages.

Which of these should not be a part of the creation of the postmortem document according to the Google's SRE best practices?
A. Root cause analysis.
B. Collaboration and Knowledge sharing.
Your answer is correct
C. Unreviewed postmortem.
D. Outlining preventive actions.
Overall explanation

Correct Answer: C

    Options A, B & D are incorrect because they are part of the process for creating a postmortem, which includes figuring out what caused the issues and how to prevent it, also it is a collaborative process with the output shared.

    Option C is CORRECT because according to Google’s SRE best practices, all postmortems should be reviewed as part of the culture of learning.

Question 5Correct

Your company currently has its containerised applications deployed in on-premises Kubernetes cluster. They have a plan to deploy a similar environment in GCP. The company is concerned about the amount of operations that will be needed to keep both environments in sync.

Which of the following can be used to keep the Kubernetes environments in sync and provide a centralised multi-cluster management?
A. CloudBuild.
Your answer is correct
B. Anthos.
C. Jenkins.
D. Cloud Source Repositories.
Overall explanation

Correct Answer: B

    Option A is incorrect. CloudBuild cannot be used to keep environment in sync or for centralised multi-cluster management.

    Option B is correct. Anthos is used for centralised multi-cluster management.

    Option C is incorrect, Jenkins is a CI/CD tool and cannot be used to keep the environment in sync or for centralised multi-cluster management.

    Option D are CORRECT because they can be used to connect two or more GCP VPCs to aid communications using private IP addresses.
