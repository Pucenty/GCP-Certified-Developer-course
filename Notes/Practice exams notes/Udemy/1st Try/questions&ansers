Question 1Correct

Your team is designing a new User-facing application to serve requests. Service Level Objectives (SLOs) have been set. Your team has been mandated to ensure the application always meets the set SLOs. Your Job is to choose Service Level Indicators (SLIs) that will allow your team effectively monitor the system so it does not breach the SLOs.

Which of the following is Google's SRE suggested best practice for selecting SLIs?
A. Choose as many SLIs as possible to cover all aspects of the system that users interact with.
B. Choose as few SLIs as possible to reduce unactionable alerts
Your answer is correct
C. Discover what users expect from the system and choose SLIs to measure it.
D. Allow users to give feedback on issues before choosing SLIs.

Overall explanation

Correct Answer: C

    Option A is incorrect, because choosing too many indicators makes it hard to pay the right level of attention to the indicators that matter

    Option B is incorrect, because choosing too few may leave significant behaviours of your system unexamined.

    Option C is CORRECT. Google’s recommended approach is an understanding of what your users want from the system will inform the judicious selection of a few indicators.

    Option D is incorrect, because it means the system isn’t monitored which is not recommended.

B. List of Actions carried out to restore the service.
Your answer is correct
C. The developers responsible for the update.
D. Command hierarchy.
Overall explanation

Correct Answer: C

Question 3Correct

You are helping with the design of a data processing pipeline for a company. Data is streamed from different devices into the pipeline and then processed before it is loaded into the final storage for analytic use.  You want to identify minimal Service Level Indicators (SLIs) for the pipeline to ensure that the data in the final storage is up to date.

Which SLI should not be part of your consideration?
A. Throughput.
B. Latency.
C. Correctness.
Your answer is correct
D. Durability.
Overall explanation

Correct Answer: D

    Option D is CORRECT, this is SLI provides no monitoring value for the data processing pipeline.

    Options A, B & C are incorrect because they are recommended SLIs for big data systems. Throughput shows speed of processing and latency shows total time to process a request. Correctness measures the accuracy of results returned.

Question 6Incorrect

Your company has tasked you with setting up a Continuous Integration pipeline. When code is committed to the source repository, the pipeline will build docker containers to be pushed to Container Registry and non-container artifacts to be pushed to Cloud Storage.

How would you accomplish this? Choose Two.
Your selection is correct
A. Add an images field, that specifies the docker images to be pushed to Artifact Registry or Container Registry, to the Cloud Build config file.
B. Add an artifacts field, that specifies the docker images to be pushed to Artifact Registry or Container Registry, to the source repository config file.
Correct selection
C. Add an artifacts field, that specifies the non-container artifacts to be stored in Cloud Storage, to the Cloud Build config file.
D. Add an images field, that specifies the non-container artifacts to be stored in Cloud Storage, to the source repository config file.
E. Add an options field, that specifies the non-container artifacts to be stored in Cloud Storage, to the source repository config file.
Overall explanation

Correct Answers: A and C

    Options A and C are CORRECT. The images field and artifacts field in the build config file specifies the docker images to be stored in the container registry and the non-container artifacts to be stored in Cloud storage respectively.

    Options B, D & E are incorrect because there is nothing like a source repository config file.

Question 7Correct

You are tasked with designing an automated CI pipeline for building and pushing images to Container Registry. In the current system, developers have to issue build commands after code is pushed to the test branch in the source repository.

What steps can you take to automate the build of the test branch with the least amount of management overhead?
A. Add a cloud build config file when code is pushed to the branch. Create a trigger in Cloud Source Repository and select the event Push to a branch .
Your answer is correct
B. Add a cloud build config file when code is pushed to the branch. Create a trigger in Cloud Build and select the event Push to a branch .
C. Add a cloud build config file when code is pushed to the branch. Create a trigger in Cloud Build and select the event Pull request .
D. Create a cloud function that is triggered when code is committed to the cloud source repository.
Overall explanation

Correct Answer: B

    Option A is incorrect, triggers are created in Cloud Build.

    Option B is CORRECT because the correct trigger is the “Push to a branch” event that will trigger a build when developers push code to their cloud source repository branch.

    Option C is incorrect, the requirement is automating the build when code is committed to the test branch, there was no mention of raising a pull request

    Option D is incorrect, it has a lot of management overhead.

Your answer is correct
B. Grant the developers the Source Repository Writer role at Repo level.
C. Grant the developers the Source Repository Reader role at Project level.
D. Grant the developers the Source Repository Admin role at Repo level.
Overall explanation

Correct Answer: B

    Option A is incorrect. This is too permissive, does not follow least privilege best practice and grants access to all the repos in that Project.

    Option B is CORRECT. This grants permissions at the repo level to list, clone, fetch and update repositories.

    Option C is incorrect. This does not give permissions to update repositories.

    Option D is incorrect. This is too permissive and does not follow least privilege best practice.

Question 10Correct

Your company is serving an application through the Compute Engine service behind a global load balancer. You have been tasked with monitoring the availability of the application and alert the on-call engineer if the application is unavailable for more than five minutes.

What should you do with the least management overhead?
A. Use Cloud Logging alerts to trigger a notification.
B. Deploy a service to the instances to notify you when they fail.
C. Create Uptime checks with the IP address of the individual VMs and an alerting policy to trigger a notification.
Your answer is correct
D. Create an Uptime check with the IP address of the load balancer and an alerting policy to trigger a notification.
Overall explanation

Correct Answer: D

    Option A is incorrect, this has a lot of overhead such as installing the logging agent, configuring the right logs to be sent to Cloud Logging and creating log-based metrics.

    Option B is incorrect, because a service on the instance may not work when the instance fails.

    Option C is incorrect. This has a lot of overhead, assuming there are 50 instances, you will have to create an uptime check and alerting policy for each VM instance. Also if one VM is replaced it will trigger an alert which is counter-productive when the application is available.

    Option D is CORRECT. Creating an uptime check to the load balancer has the least administrative overhead.
