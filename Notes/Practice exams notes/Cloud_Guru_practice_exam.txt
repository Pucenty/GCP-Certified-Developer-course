SLI/SLO/SLA

2xx status: 900,000 3xx status: 40,000 4xx status: 50,000 5xx status: 10,000
HTTP 3xx status messages mean further action is needed to complete the request, so they are NOT good or valid events. The HTTP 4xx error indicates a syntax problem or a request that can't be fulfilled, so they are also NOT good or valid events. The HTTP 2xx status client code shows successful, valid, and good events. The HTTP 5xx server failure status code shows valid, but NOT good server events. This would mean that the SLI = ( 900,000 good events / 910,000 valid events) x 100%. That brings the SLI to 98.9%.
