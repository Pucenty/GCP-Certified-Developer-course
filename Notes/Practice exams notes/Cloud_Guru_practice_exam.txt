Designate a development team member as the incident commander.

VPC Flow Logs

VPC Flow Logs are enabled per subnet, and log a sample of all network traffic on that subnet.

Which of these scenarios require installing and configuring custom monitoring agents on your GCP resources? Pick TWO options.

View memory usage metrics on Compute Engine instances.

Memory usage requires the monitoring agent to be installed.

SLI/SLO/SLA
SLI<=SLO
or
(lower bound <= SLI <= upper bound) = SLO

Example SLIs:
request latency
failure rate - unsuccessful requests/all requests
batch Throughput - propotion of time = data processing rate > treshhold

4 Google Golden Signals

Latency - time it takes for service to fulfill request
Traffic - how much demand is directed at your service
Errors - the rate at which your service fails
Saturation - how close to fully utilized your resources are

2xx status: 900,000 3xx status: 40,000 4xx status: 50,000 5xx status: 10,000
HTTP 3xx status messages mean further action is needed to complete the request, so they are NOT good or valid events. The HTTP 4xx error indicates a syntax problem or a request that can't be fulfilled, so they are also NOT good or valid events. The HTTP 2xx status client code shows successful, valid, and good events. The HTTP 5xx server failure status code shows valid, but NOT good server events. This would mean that the SLI = ( 900,000 good events / 910,000 valid events) x 100%. That brings the SLI to 98.9%.
